This is a group for women\* who are interested in [Free Software](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/). We get together about once in a month online to meet, give talks about topics we find interesting in the area of Free Software and discuss recent developments. The group is women-centric and open to all women, inter, trans and non-binary people.
